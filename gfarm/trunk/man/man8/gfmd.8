.SH NAME
gfmd(8) \- Gfarm metadata server
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgfmd\fR [ \fB\fIoptions\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgfmd\fR is a Gfarm filesystem metadata server for accessing
filesystem metadata of the Gfarm filesystem.  \fBgfmd\fR is needed to
be running on a metadata server node in advance.
.PP
It is possible for \fBgfmd\fR to be executed as a non-privileged user
process although only the user that executes the \fBgfmd\fR can be authenticated.
Other users cannot use it.
.PP
In order to execute \fBgfmd\fR as a non-privileged user process, a
configuration file for a user needs to be specified by the -f option.
At least, the port number used by \fBgfmd\fR should be altered to a
non-privileged port number by metadb_serverport statement in the
configuration file or the -p option.
.PP
In this case, the altered port number of \fBgfmd\fR should be
specified by the metadb_serverport statement in \fI~/.gfarmrc\fR
or \fI%%SYSCONFDIR%%/gfarm.conf\fR on a client node.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-L \fIlog-level\fB\fR
specifies a log priority level.  The log output, which priority
is higher or equal to this level, will be sent to syslog or standard error.
Please refer gfarm.conf(5) for the priority levels which can be specified
by this option.
.TP
\fB-P \fIpid-file\fB\fR
specifies a file name which records the process ID of gfmd.
.TP
\fB-d\fR
specifies the debug mode.  With the -d option, gfmd is running as a
foreground process not a daemon.

If this option is specified and \fB-L\fR is not specified,
the log level is set to "debug".
.TP
\fB-f \fIconfig-file\fB\fR
specifies a configuration file that is read instead of the default
configuration file.
.TP
\fB-p \fIport\fB\fR
specifies a port number used by gfmd.  By default, 601 is used.

Default port requires the root privilege, although privileged ports
are not necessary to execute gfmd.
.TP
\fB-s \fIsyslog-facility\fB\fR
specifies a syslog facility to report errors by gfmd.  By default,
local0 is used.
.TP
\fB-u \fI\fB\fR
specifies a syslog facility to report errors by gfmd.  By default,
local0 is used.
.TP
\fB-?\fR
displays a list of command options.
