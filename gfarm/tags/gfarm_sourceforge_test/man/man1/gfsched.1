.SH NAME
gfsched \- create a host file using file-affinity scheduling
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgfsched\fR [ \fB-U\fR ] [ \fB-I \fIfragment-index\fB\fR ] [ \fB-p \fIgfarm-program-URL\fB\fR ] \fB\fIgfarm-URL\fB\fR [ \fB\fIoutput-hostfile\fB\fR ]


\fBgfsched\fR [ \fB-U\fR ] \fB-N \fInumber\fB\fR [ \fB-p \fIgfarm-program-URL\fB\fR ] [ \fB\fIhost\fB\fR\fI ...\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgfsched\fR creates a host file
using the file-affinity scheduing of \fIgfarm-URL\fR.
In other words, \fBgfsched\fR chooses and displays
hostnames of the same number with the fragments of
the \fIgfarm-URL\fR, with giving priority to
the hosts which has the fragment as far as possible.
When \fIoutput-hostfile\fR is omitted,
\fBgfsched\fR displays to the standard output.
.PP
If \fB-N\fR is specified instead of 
\fIgfarm-URL\fR, \fBgfsched\fR chooses and
displays specified number of hosts from the hosts in the arguments.
If no host is specified in the argument, \fBgfsched\fR
chooses hosts from all registered hosts.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-I \fIfragment-index\fB\fR
specifies the fragment index to be scheduled.
.TP
\fB-U\fR
suppresses authentication check.
Without this option, the scheduler checks whether the user will be 
successfully authenticated with the hosts or not.
This option omits the check to make scheduling faster,
but that makes a risk that hosts which make authentication failure with
the user may be scheduled.
.TP
\fB-p \fIprogram-URL\fB\fR
creates a host file with a program name which will be used
to process the \fIgfarm-URL\fR.
In other words, only hosts which can run the \fIprogram-URL\fR
will be selected, if this option is specified.
.TP
\fB-?\fR
displays a list of command options.
