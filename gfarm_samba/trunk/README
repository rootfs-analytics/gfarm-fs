Gfarm Samba VFS module v0.0.1
----------

INSTALL

Before building this vfs module, you need to get source code of samba and install
gfarm-devel package or put the gfarm source code to include directory.


$ ./configure --with-samba-source=SAMBA_SOURCE_DIRECTORY
$ make


Then, copy gfarm_vfs.so to samba vfs directory as a super user.
(The directory is "/usr/lib64/samba/vfs" in RHEL5 x86_64.)

# cp gfarm_vfs.so SAMBA_VFS_DIRECTORY

Add following settings to smb.conf:
-----
[gfarm]
        comment = Gfarm FS
        path = /
        vfs objects = gfarm_vfs
        writeable = yes
        browseable = yes
-----

Restart samba and access \\sambahostname\gfarm with windows explorer.
