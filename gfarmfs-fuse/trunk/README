*** GfarmFS-FUSE

Using GfarmFS-FUSE, you can mount your Gfarm filesystem in your userspace.

GfarmFS-FUSE requires Gfarm version 1.1.1 (or later) and FUSE version
2.2 (or later) development packages.

  Gfarm:
      http://datafarm.apgrid.org/

  FUSE:
      http://fuse.sourceforge.net/


*** Installation

Make sure Gfarm and FUSE are installed.

Installation steps of GfarmFS-FUSE:

    $ ./configure [options]
    $ make
    $ make install

Options for configure:

  --enable-symlink

  specifies to enable symlink(2) to work.  Enabling this option, 
  symlink(2) creates a special file named NAME.gfarmfs-symlink instead 
  of creating NAME.
  As default, symlink(2) doesn't work on GfarmFS-FUSE because current 
  version of Gfarm, 1.1.1, doesn't support it.

  --enable-linkiscopy

  specifies to enable link(2) to behaves copying a file instead of 
  creating a hardlink.
  As default, link(2) doesn't work on GfarmFS-FUSE because current 
  version of Gfarm, 1.1.1, doesn't support it.

  --prefix=directory

  specifies a destination directory for installation.  The 'gfarmfs'
  command is installed in 'directory'/bin.  Default is /usr/local 
  directory and /usr/local/bin/gfarmfs is created.

Example of configure:

    $ env CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/grid/gfarm/include' \
    LDFLAGS='-L/usr/grid/gfarm/lib -Wl,-R,/usr/grid/gfarm/lib' \
    ./configure --enable-symlink --enable-linkiscopy \
    --prefix=/home/myname/local


*** Mount

Make sure your Gfarm environment is set. (see ISNTALL.en of Gfarm)
Run the 'gfarmfs' command as normal user in your Gfarm environment:

    $ gfarmfs mountpoint -s [fuse-options]

  Note:
  * The `-s' option is neccessary to disable Multi-threaded operation.
  * Only you can usually access the mountpoint. (see README of FUSE)


*** Unmount

Run the 'fusermount' command (see README of FUSE):

    $ fusermount -u mountpoint
