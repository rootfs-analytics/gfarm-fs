*** Preconditon

The expected files (./expected/*.out) is depend on:

  - FUSE version 2.6
  - Gfarm version 1.4

The test for gfarmfs expects that the Gfarm environment setting is finished.

*** Do test

  $ make check

*** Check files if errors happen

  $ cat ./diffs/*.out

*** Update expected results (for another version of FUSE or Gfarm)

  $ make check
  (make sure ./_output/*.out files)
  $ mv ./output/*.out ./expected/
