[2006.??.??] Version 1.3

New Features

  * add FUSE 2.5 compatible mode. (auto configuration)
    This mode can works correctly about open(2), creat(2), access(2),
    fgetattr(2), ftruncate(2).
    And, --fastcreate become needless.
  * enable statfs(2) to work.
  * add -S and --disable-statfs options.
  * add -b and --buffered options.
  * add -F and --exactfilesize options.
  * add -n and --dirnlink options.
  * add --trace option.
  * add KNOWN_PROBLEMS in README.

Update Features

  * new usage of short options. (ex. -lsu)
  * do not count nlink of a directory by default setting.
    (default is 32000.) (-d option can count nlink of a directory.)
  * remove -f and --fastcreate options.
    (change default behavior on FUSE 2.2)
  * "file section" in the case of one is opened in index view. 
  * do not use I/O buffer.  (-b option use I/O buffer.)
  * When the file is not readable, hard link emulation will work,
    if possible.

Avoid limitations of libgfarm

  * stat(2) can return a exact st_size during open(2) on the same
    gfarmfs client.
  * Using -F option, stat(2) can return a exact st_size during open(2)
    from the another gfarmfs client.
  * utime(2) and chmod(2) is effective during open(2) on the same
    gfarmfs client.
  * rename(2) and chmod(2) do not destroy the metadata during open(2)
    on the same gfarmfs client.

Bug fix

  * maintain mtime and atime at hard link emulation.
  * fix a bug such that gfs_pio_create can create invalid FIFO.
  * fix a bug such that chown(2) for a symlink entry become ENOENT.
